Description: A query generator based on Edgar F. Codd's relational
    algebra and operator names (plus experience using 'SQL' at big data
    scale).  The design represents an attempt to make 'SQL' more teachable by
    denoting composition a sequential pipeline notation instead of nested
    queries or functions.  Package features include: data processing trees
    or pipelines as observable objects (able to report both columns
    produced and columns used), optimized 'SQL' generation as an explicit
    user visible modeling step, and convenience methods for applying query
    trees to in-memory 'data.frame's.
