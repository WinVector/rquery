A common data manipulation need is: applying the same operation to a number of columns.

In the [`rquery`](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery) [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) package we strongly recommend using value-oriented (or standard evaluation) for this task.

Here is what this looks like.

For our data lets build a simple data set similar to `mtcars`:

```{r}
library(wrapr)
library(rquery)
have_rqdatatable <- requireNamespace('rqdatatable', quietly = TRUE)

example_data <- wrapr::build_frame(
   "mpg"  , "cyl", "disp",  "car"               |
     21   , 6    , 160   ,  "Mazda RX4"         |
     21   , 6    , 160   ,  "Mazda RX4 Wag"     |
     22.8 , 4    , 108   ,  "Datsun 710"        |
     21.4 , 6    , 258   ,  "Hornet 4 Drive"    |
     18.7 , 8    , 360   ,  "Hornet Sportabout" |
     18.1 , 6    , 225   ,  "Valiant"           )

knitr::kable(example_data)
```

Now suppose for a number of columns we wish to perform a calculation, such centering it with respect to the grand average.

This is easily handled by first specifying the set of variables we wish to work with.

```{r}
vars <- setdiff(colnames(example_data), 'car')

print(vars)
```

Now we build up what we want as a name-vector of strings using the [`:=` named map builder](https://winvector.github.io/wrapr/articles/named_map_builder.html). 

```{r}
expressions <- vars := paste0(vars, ' - mean(', vars, ')')

print(expressions)
```

The idea is: the `:=` operator fits into `R` idiom by looking very much like a vectorized version of "names get assigned expressions".

These expressions can then be used in an `rquery` pipeline using the `_se`-variant of `extend()`: `extend_se()`.

```{r}
ops <- local_td(example_data) %.>%
  extend_se(., expressions)

cat(format(ops))
```

And this operator pipeline is ready to use (assuming we have `rqdatatable` available):

```{r}
if(have_rqdatatable) {
  example_data %.>%
    ops %.>%
    knitr::kable(.)
}
```

The expression construction can also be done inside the `extend_se()` operator.

```{r}
ops <- local_td(example_data) %.>%
  extend_se(., vars := paste0(vars, ' - mean(', vars, ')'))

cat(format(ops))
```

The point is: we use standard `R` tools to build up the lists of names and operations.  We are not restricted to any single argument manipulation grammar.

For example we could build all interaction terms as follows.

```{r}
combos <- t(combn(vars, 2))
interactions <- 
  paste0(combos[, 1], '_', combos[, 2]) := 
  paste0(combos[, 1], ' * ', combos[, 2])

ops <- local_td(example_data) %.>%
  extend_se(., interactions)

cat(format(ops))
```

What we can do is limited only by the power of `R` itself.

It is a critical advantage to work with sets of variables as standard values. Bringing in a whole theory of un-evaluated expressions can in fact be less-powerful than working with values.

Note: we also supply an alias for `:=` as `%:=%` for those that don't want to confuse this assignment with how the symbol is used in `data.table`.  Take care that `:=` has the precedence-level of an assignment and `%:=%` has the precedence-level of a user defined operator.

As, as always, our queries can be used on data.

```{r}
if(have_rqdatatable) {
  example_data %.>%
    ops %.>%
    knitr::kable(.)
}
```


Or even in a database.

```{r}
have_db <- requireNamespace("DBI", quietly = TRUE) && 
  requireNamespace("RSQLite", quietly = TRUE)

if(have_db) {
  raw_connection <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), 
                                   ":memory:")
  RSQLite::initExtension(raw_connection)
  db <- rquery_db_info(
    connection = raw_connection,
    is_dbi = TRUE,
    connection_options = rq_connection_tests(raw_connection))
  
  rq_copy_to(db, 'example_data',
             example_data,
             temporary = TRUE, 
             overwrite = TRUE)
  
  sql <- to_sql(ops, db)
  
  cat(format(sql))
}
```


```{r}
if(have_db) {
  res_table <- materialize(db, ops)
  DBI::dbReadTable(raw_connection, res_table$table_name) %.>%
    knitr::kable(.)
}
```


```{r}
if(have_db) {
  DBI::dbDisconnect(raw_connection)
}
```
